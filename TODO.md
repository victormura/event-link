# TODO (Event Link)

## High
- [x] Localization (RO/EN) for UI labels and outbound emails with Accept-Language support.
- [x] [EL-3] Student signup: allow students to create an account with email + password so they can register for events.
- [x] [EL-4] User login: allow both students and organizers to log into their account securely to use the platform.
- [x] [EL-6] Organizer create event form: provide a form for organizers to create and publish new events.
- [x] [EL-12] Enforce capacity limits: automatically stop new registrations when an event reaches its maximum number of seats.
- [x] [EL-13] Student event list: show a list of all upcoming events on the main page so students stay informed about what’s happening.
- [x] [EL-14] Event details page: when a student clicks an event in the list, show a full details page (description, time, organizer, location, etc.).
- [x] [EL-15] Event registration button: on the event details page, show an “Enroll / Register” button for logged‑in students to reserve a spot.
- [x] [EL-21] Event tags for recommendations: allow organizers to add relevant tags to events so the recommendation engine can match events to interested students.
- [x] [EL-22] “Recommended for you” section: show students a personalized list of recommended events based on their registration history.
- [x] Add Alembic migrations and replace `AUTO_CREATE_TABLES` in production; generate migration for cover_url/attended columns.
- [x] Harden auth: central organizer/student dependency helpers, consistent JWT expiry validation, and rate limit login/register.
- [x] Implement global exception/response wrapper for consistent error payloads (code/message) across APIs.
- [x] Add organizer invite approval audit trail (store who/when upgraded, not just code).
- [x] Student unregister flow in UI (button state, messages) wired to new DELETE endpoint.
- [x] Organizer upgrade UI: handle invalid/missing invite code error states with UX copy.
- [x] Participant attendance toggle: add backend tests and UI loading/error states.
- [x] Event validation: max length constraints, cover_url validation, password complexity; return structured errors.
- [x] Recommendations: exclude past events and respect capacity/full state.
- [x] Event pagination: add controls for page size selection and display total pages; update backend tests for page_size.
- [x] Add 403/404 routing guards coverage in Angular tests.
- [x] CI pipeline (GitHub Actions): install deps, run backend tests, run Angular tests.
- [x] CI: run Angular tests headless (ChromeHeadless) to avoid display errors in Actions.
- [x] Make sure emailing actually works, and configure it otherwise so that mails are being sent.

## Medium
- [x] [EL-7] Organizer edit event: allow organizers to edit details of events they created (title, description, time, capacity, etc.).
- [x] [EL-8] Organizer delete event: allow organizers to delete/cancel an event they created when it will no longer take place.
- [x] [EL-9] Organizer event dashboard: provide a page where organizers can see a list of all events they have created for centralized management.
- [x] [EL-10] Participant list for organizers: show organizers the list of students registered for one of their events so they can manage attendance.
- [x] [EL-16] “My Events” page for students: provide a page where a logged‑in student can see the list of events they are registered for.
- [x] Docker + docker-compose for backend/frontend/Postgres with env wiring and docs.
- [x] Security headers middleware (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options) and CORS audit.
- [x] Health/readiness endpoint to check DB connectivity for probes.
- [x] Logging: structured logs with request IDs; log key domain events (auth, event CRUD, registrations).
- [x] Email metrics/counters and optional retry/backoff on SMTP failures.
- [x] Add organizer ability to export participants including attendance + cover URL in CSV.
- [x] Event cover images: add image upload option or validated URL regex; show placeholder on missing/failed load.
- [x] Persist filter/query params in event list for shareable links.
- [x] Add route-level guard to redirect logged-in users away from login/register.
- [x] Add frontend loading/error spinners for event details/register actions.
- [x] Improve accessibility: form labels/aria, focus states, keyboard nav on filters and pagination.
- [x] Password reset flow (request + token + reset form) with backend email template.
- [x] Refresh tokens with short-lived access tokens to reduce JWT leak impact.
- [x] Per-IP and per-account rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (login, register, password reset).
- [x] Email templating (HTML + localization) and resend confirmation option for registrations.
- [x] Background cleanup job for expired invites/tokens and past event registrations.
- [x] Role-based permission matrix documentation and tests ensuring unauthorized calls are blocked.
- [x] Database indexes for common query fields (event start_time, category, owner_id, tags).
- [x] Timezone-aware date handling end-to-end (backend, Angular date pipes, database).
- [x] ICS calendar export for events and calendar subscription per user.
- [x] Configuration sanity checks at startup (fail fast if essential env vars are missing).
- [x] Full mobile/phone compatibility across core pages (nav, event lists/details/forms).
- [x] Backend pytest migration + coverage thresholds for core flows (auth, events, register, recommendations, reset).
- [x] Frontend Angular unit test fixes (ActivatedRoute providers) + coverage thresholds; stabilize CI headless runs.
- [x] End-to-end tests (Playwright) for auth, event browse, register/unregister, and organizer edit flows.
- [x] Stress/load tests for critical endpoints (event list, registration, recommendations).
- [x] Pagination and sorting for all list endpoints (registrations, users).
- [ ] Task queue for background jobs (emails/heavy processing).
- [ ] Account deletion / data export flows for privacy regulations.
- [x] CI caching for npm/pip to speed up pipelines and document cache keys.
